#  Error Handling in solidity
This repository is made for my ethereum intermediate avax project which is used to execute Error Handling process in Solidity. 

## Problem Statement

create a contract  to  deploy error handling process in solidity by using revert(), assert() and require() statement.


## Description

1) Create a contract named Avax
2) initialize a variable (here variable is b) b=5;
3) create a function named module2 and pass num as parameter and set a condition where num should not be equal to 0
4) create a second fuction called requirement and pass parameter a and add a Require fuction where the condition is "a" should be greater than 0
5) Now to demonstrate the revert fuction create a function named revertion and pass num1 and num2 as parameters, and for the revert function set a condition where
     the num1 should not be less than the num2.
6) finally perforn the operation mentioned for the function and return the result of the operation to the function.
    
## Getting Started

### Executing Program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at (https://remix.ethereum.org/.)

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., error.sol). Copy and paste the following code written by me into the file.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set heigher to "0.8.1" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile error.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MyContract" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

After deployment of  the contract call the function addition() , subtraction() and sulo() by providing value, it perform error handling process by  using revert, assert, require statement.
